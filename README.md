# Student Class

In this assignment, you'll be implementing the Student class. 

Your Student class should contain the following components:
* Private instance variables for first name, last name, and class year
* Two constructors to create a Student (one default and one with three parameters)
* doSomething() method that just printed out something that the student was doing
* toString() method to print out a Studentâ€™s full name and class year
* Getters and setters for all three variables



Add code to [Student.java](src/main/java/Student.java) to define the class, and then add code to [StudentClient.java](src/main/java/StudentClient.java) to test your code

## Run your client code with:
```shell script
make run
```
